Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
* file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
* ID: [id="my-concept-module-a_{context}"]
* Title: = My concept module A

ID is a unique identifier that can be used to reference this module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.

The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID so you can include it multiple times in the same guide.

Be sure to include a line break between the title and the module introduction.

In the title of concept modules, include nouns or noun phrases that are used in the body text. This helps readers and search engines find the information quickly. Do not start the title of concept modules with a verb or gerund. See also _Wording of headings_ in _IBM Style_.

[role="_abstract"]
{% if examples -%}
Write a short introductory paragraph that provides an overview of the module.

The contents of a concept module give the user descriptions and explanations needed to understand and use a product.

* Look at nouns and noun phrases in related procedure modules and assemblies to find the concepts to explain to users.
* Explain only things that are visible to users. Even if a concept is interesting, it probably does not require explanation if it is not visible to users.
* Avoid including action items. Action items belong in procedure modules. However, in some cases a concept or reference can include suggested actions when those actions are simple, are highly dependent on the context of the module, and have no place in any procedure module. In such cases, ensure that the heading of the concept or reference remains a noun phrase and not a gerund.

////
Do not include third-level headings (===).

Include titles and alternative text descriptions for images and enclose the descriptions in straight quotation marks (""). Alternative text should provide a textual, complete description of the image as a full sentence.

Images should never be the sole means of conveying information and should only supplement the text.

Avoid screenshots or other images that might quickly go out of date and that create a maintenance burden on documentation. Provide text equivalents for every diagram, image, or other non-text element. Avoid using images of text instead of actual text.

Example image:

.Image title
image::image-file.png["A textual representation of the essential information conveyed by the image."]

Optional. Delete if not used.

Provide a bulleted list of links and display text relevant to the concept module. These links can include `link:` and `xref:` macros. Do not include additional text.
